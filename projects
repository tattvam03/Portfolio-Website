<h3 class = "project-completed"> Spy drone:🎮 </h3> I built a "Spy Drone" entirely from scratch, focusing on compactness and stealth. It's designed to be both very small and extremely quiet, perfect for discreet operations.

<h3 class = "project-completed"> Raag recognition:🎶 </h3> In this work, I implement ML, DL, and other techniques for raag identification. I apply these techniques to the Bhatkhande North Indian Classical Music Dataset and conduct a comparative analysis by evaluating the performance of each technique.

Implemented a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction and enhanced user experience.

<h3 class = "project-completed"> A fighter bot:🚗 </h3> I built a fighter bot car specifically for car battles, and it performed so well that I won the match with it. It's designed for strength and agility in combat. 

<h3 class = "project-completed"> Face & eye recognition system:👨👀 </h3> I developed a Face & Eye Recognition System that precisely detects and identifies both facial features and eye patterns. It enhances security by providing detailed biometric authentication.
