Hello world, I am a Web developer from <span style = "color:orange">In</span><span style = "color:#4fc3f7">d</span><span style = "color:#66bb6a">ia</span>.

I am a final year Computer Science undergrad, however, I have been coding for more than five years. And I love to code, and make cool things with code.

My love for computers began when I saw my elder brother make cool things with code. 💻

Presently, my main interests lie in Web development and MERN stack , but I also enjoy working on AI/ML and Robotics related things.
